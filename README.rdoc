= Foclóir

A dictionary server.

Foclóir looks up words on dictionary.reference.com, and shows the results. It
caches the definition.

That's it, pretty much.

Foclóir (fuc-LORE) is the Irish for dictionary.

== Installation

It's a Ruby on Rails application. Put it up on your server, create your
database.yml file, and let it run.
